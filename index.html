        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element and are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTLM document.</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements that are nested inside other elements.</li>
          <li>Parent elements hold other elements, aka the child elements. </li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Use semantic HTML elements when possible because they make your HTML easier to read by other deveoplers and the browser.</li>
          <li>When working with visisble HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
          <li>The words "element" and "tag" are commonly sued interchangeably in the web development world, but its important to know the difference.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
            <li>External CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage. It allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
            <li>Separation of concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use. Its based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
            <li>CSS box model consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
            <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRy can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigning the CSS rule.</li>
